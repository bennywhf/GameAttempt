This was an early attempt of mine at understanding multiplayer communication. My aim was to have a program that uses UDP to send and recieve key presses. Each player controls his own ball by pressing directional keys. Pressing these keys also sends the other player a message so that the "remote player" ball is moved accordingly. I never got to finishing this personal project, however it gave a lot of insight into how difficult real time communication is; as well as inspire me to keep pushing myself and get better at what I love.
